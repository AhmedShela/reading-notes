# Node.js Introduction

## What is Node.js?
- Node.js is an open source server environment
- Node.js is free
- Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
- Node.js uses JavaScript on the server

## Why Node.js?

A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the client.

Here is how PHP or ASP handles a file request:

- Sends the task to the computer's file system.
- Waits while the file system opens and reads the file.
- Returns the content to the client.
- Ready to handle the next request.
Here is how Node.js handles a file request:

- Sends the task to the computer's file system.
- Ready to handle the next request.
- When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.

Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.

## What Can Node.js Do?
- Node.js can generate dynamic page content
- Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
- Node.js can collect form data
- Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database

## What is a Node.js File?
- Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events
- A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server
- Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect
- Node.js files have extension ".js"

# What exactly is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment. Sounds great, but what does that mean? How does that work?

The Node.js run-time environment includes everything you need to execute a program written in JavaScript.

Node.js came into existence when the original developers of JavaScript extended it from something you could only run in the browser to something you could run on your machine as a standalone application.

Now you can do much more with JavaScript than just making websites interactive.

JavaScript now has the capability to do things that other scripting languages like Python can do.

Both your browser JavaScript and Node.js run on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine. This engine takes your JavaScript code and converts it into a faster machine code. Machine code is low-level code which the computer can run without needing to first interpret it.

## Why Node.js?

Here’s a formal definition as given on the official Node.js website:

`Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

Node.js’ package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.`

# About npm

npm is the world’s largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

npm consists of three distinct components:

- the website
- the Command Line Interface (CLI)
- the registry

## Use npm to . . .

* Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
* Download standalone tools you can use right away.
* Run packages without downloading using npx.
* Share code with any npm user, anywhere.
* Restrict code to specific developers.
* Create Orgs (organizations) to coordinate package maintenance, coding, and developers.
* Form virtual teams by using Orgs.
* Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.
* Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.
* Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.
* Find other developers who are working on similar problems and projects.
