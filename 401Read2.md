1- Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?

Running JavaScript without/outside a browser means you are using node.js technology to execute your JavaScript code. This type of usage of javascript typically refers to backend programming where your javascript code will interact with your database and can be used to create RESTful APIs.

A module is a single file (or files) that are imported under one import and used. e.g.

`import my_module`
A package is a collection of modules in directories that give a package hierarchy.

The node community around the world creates useful modules and publishes them as packages in this repository.

4- Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module

* module (“ES modules” or “ECMAScript modules”) are a major new feature, or rather a collection of new features.

* A package is one or more modules (libraries) grouped (or packaged) together.

* node package manager is a command line tool that installs, updates or uninstalls Node. js packages in your application. It is also an online repository for open-source Node. js packages.
